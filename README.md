# 'Z-Factors' Chemical Engineering Laboratory. 
## ChE 180A at UC Santa Barbara
UCSB's Chemical Engineering 180A Lab: 'Z-Factors'. Data plotted in python, report written in LaTeX. 

### What is a 'z-factor?'
When a gas is highly compressed, it can exhibit non-ideal gas behaviors. The measurement of non-ideality is called a 'z-factor', a ratio of it's real / ideal pressure. For a more elaborate explanation, read the [lab report](https://github.com/wesleyZero/Z_Factors_UCSB-ChE/blob/main/README_RESOURCES/ZFactorsReport.pdf). If you are curious about how the report was generated in LaTeX, you can see the [LaTeX code](https://github.com/wesleyZero/Z_Factors_UCSB-ChE/blob/main/Z_Factors_LaTeX/main.tex).

## Description
I wanted to use python to plot and manipulate data for my engineering lab class. So I made a module called ['ChEplot'](https://github.com/wesleyZero/Z_Factors_UCSB-ChE/blob/main/ChE_plotter/ChE.py) that simplifies CSV data reading, manipulation, as well as the plotting. I then wrote a short script in [z_factors.py](https://github.com/wesleyZero/Z_Factors_UCSB-ChE/blob/main/ChE_plotter/z_factors.py) to use this tool. Virtually all of the code in the script is just parameters because all of the work is done by the module.
